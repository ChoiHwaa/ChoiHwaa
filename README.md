👋 Hi, I’m @ChoiHwaa. I'm not a serious coder but once I get started there's no stopping me.

👀 I’m interested in Telegram, Python, and developing bots.

🌱 I’m currently learning Japanese and familiarising myself with coding bots using [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bot development.

📫 How to reach me [Telegram](http://t.me/+p5eEQ2QDuF1hMThk).
